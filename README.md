# 🧬 The Blood-Brain Mirror: Transcriptomics Analysis

> **Topic:** Alzheimer's Disease, APOE Genotype, & Blood-Brain Barrier
> **Based on:** Panitch et al. (2022)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a visual summary of a transcriptomic study exploring how blood can serve as a proxy for brain inflammation in Alzheimer's patients, specifically those carrying the *APOE ε4* risk allele.

The goal is to simplify complex multi-tissue analysis (Brain vs. Blood) into an accessible, magazine-style format.
